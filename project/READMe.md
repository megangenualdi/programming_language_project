### Getting started

To start this project, make sure you have Go installed on your computer and clone the repository.
Create an json file type with an empty `{}` in it. This will serve as your database.

The command to run this application requires two variables to be passed in with the run command: `FILEPATH` and `PORT`.
Run command: `PORT=<port number> FILEPATH=<file path to json file> go run main.go`
